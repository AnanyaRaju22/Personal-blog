    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h2>Hey, Ananya here!</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Ananya R, and I am currently a third-year B.Tech Computer Science student at REVA University. My academic journey began at Hongirana PU College, CBSE, where I achieved 90% in my SSLC, and continued at Masters PU College Hassan, where I excelled with a 96% in my PUC. I hail from the beautiful town of Jog Falls in the Shimoga district.
        From a young age, I have had a passion for dance and have been trained in Bharatanatyam. Alongside my love for dance, I am an enthusiastic sports player, having represented my school at the state level in table tennis and winning the overall student championship in 7th grade. I am a friendly and extroverted person who enjoys making new connections and engaging in diverse activities.</p>
